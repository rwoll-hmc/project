Language Implementation
=======================

Describe your implementation. In
particular, answer the following questions:

-   What host language did you use (i.e., in what language did you
    implement your DSL)? Why did you choose this host language (i.e.,
    why is it well-suited for your language design)?
-   Is yours an external or an internal DSL (or some combination thereof)? Why
    is that the right design?
-   Provide an overview of the architecture of your language: front, middle, and
    back-end, along with any technologies used to implement these components.
-   "Parsing": How does your DSL take a user program and turn it into
    something that can be executed? How do the data and control
    structures of your DSL connect to the underlying semantic model?
-   Intermediate representation: What data structure(s) in the host language do
    you use to represent a program in your DSL?
-   Execution: How did you implement the computational model? Describe
    the structure of your code and any special programming techniques
    you used to implement your language. In particular, how do the
    semantics of your host language differ from the semantics of your
    DSL?
