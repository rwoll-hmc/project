Evaluation
==========

Provide some analysis of the work you did. In
particular:

-   How "DSL-y" is your language? How close or far away is it from a general-
    purpose language?
-   What works well in your language? What are you particularly pleased with?
-   What could be improved? For example, how could the user's experience
    be better? How might your implementation be simpler or more
    cohesive? Are there more features you'd like to have? Does your current
    implementation differ from your larger vision for the language?
-   Re-visit your evaluation plan from the beginning of the project. Which tools
    have you used to evaluate the quality of your design? What have you learned
    from these evaluations? Have you made any significant changes as a result of
    these tools, the critiques, or user tests?
-   Where did you run into trouble and why? For example, did you come up
    with some syntax that you found difficult to implement, given your
    host language choice? Did you want to support multiple features, but
    you had trouble getting them to play well together?
-   If you worked as a pair, describe how you have divided your labor and
    whether that division has worked well.
