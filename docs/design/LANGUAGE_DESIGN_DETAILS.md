Language Design Details
=======================

Give a high-level overview of your language's
design. Be sure to answer the following questions:

-   How does a user write programs in your language (e.g., do they type
    in commands, use a visual/graphical tool, speak, etc.)?
-   How does the syntax of your language help users write programmers
    more easily than the syntax of a general-purpose language?
-   What is the basic computation that your language performs (i.e.,
    what is the computational model)?
-   What are the basic data structures in your DSL, if any? How does a the user
    create and manipulate data?
-   What are the basic control structures in your DSL, if any? How does the user
    specify or manipulate control flow?
-   What kind(s) of input does a program in your DSL require? What
    kind(s) of output does a program produce?
-   Error handling: How can programs go wrong, and how does your
    language communicate those errors to the user?
-   What tool support (e.g., error-checking, development environments)
    does your project provide?
-   Are there any other DSLs for this domain? If so, what are they, and
    how does your language compare to these other languages?
